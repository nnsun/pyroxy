# pyroxy

Pyroxy is a simple local web proxy written in Python that tracks the amount of network traffic directed to and from each domain.

A user can set a usage limit for a specific domainâ€”once the limit is hit, no further traffic is allowed. The total bandwidth to each domain can be tracked as well.
